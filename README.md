# Baby Step Giant Step for Elliptic Curves in F_p Parallelized, but is in C.

*(you can checkout branch `baby-Fp` for baby-step-giant-step algorithm in `Fp` instead)*

## Introduction

A child project of a child project spawned from [baby-giant-Fp-parallel](https://github.com/Mistsuu/baby-giant-Fp-parallel), and it's is in **C**.

This is an algorithm that tries to find the solution to the following problem: Given `G` and `G^k modÂ p`, find `k`.

This repo is made for educational purposes, and for fun.

Utilizes **GMP version 6.2.1**.

## Usages

```
git clone https://github.com/Mistsuu/BabyStepGiantStepC
cd BabyStepGiantStepC
make -j16
```

to produce `./dlog`.

### Input supplying

To use `./dlog`, we supply input as a list of numbers seperated by a newline (`\n`) in the following format:

```
<p>
<G>
<G^k mod p>
<upper k bound>
```

### Customize your number of threads

You can run `./dlog <num_threads>` to specify the number of threads used in multithreading part. If not specified, the default value for `num_threads` is `4`. 

### Limit your memory

In the newer version, running `./dlog <num_threads> <memory_limit>` will run `./dlog` with limited memory. Suitable for machines where not enough RAM is available. The format of `<memory_limit>` is a `double` value followed by `M` - **megabytes** (*for example,* `4096M`) or `G` - **gigabytes** (*for example,* `1.25G`). If only a `double` value is given, the unit will be `G` by default.

If you don't specify this part at all, the program will use any amount of memory as it likes.

### Output

The output will either be a number *(a negative one is normal)*, or `None`, or some error data *(only happens in the case of memory error or thread creation error, which is not often as long as `<upper k bound>` is small enough that its square root fits 64-bits)*.

## Example

For example, to recover `k` from:

```python
G = 14484073937158643
pow(G, k, p) = 14484073937158643
p = 17524524814163177
```

where we know the order of `G` is `17524524814163176` using `8` threads limited to **1GB** of memory.

We can run `./dlog 8 1G` & supply the following input:

```
17524524814163177
14484073937158643
16341616837220933
17524524814163176
```

Which gives the output:

```
8766935282215935
```

If compiled with `BUILD=verbose` *(see the next section, **Compile modes**, for more detail)*, it will produce some outputs like this:

## Compile modes

Running `make`, you can specify `BUILD` variable to `release`, `verbose`, `memcheck` which creates different kind of builds:

- `release`: Using `dlog` will produce no debug output. *(default)*
- `verbose`: Using `dlog` will produce debug output such as:
  - The size of allocated memory to construct the `L` and `R` `char` buffers in the baby step giant step algorithm.
  - Time took for each sub-operations.
  - And many more...
- `memcheck`: Which just compiles the code with `-fsanitize=address`. Helpful in looking for memory leaks in the code.
- `static`: Provides static build for the code.

## How it works

### Baby Step Giant Step Algorithm Basic

The algorithm does this by storing `n+1` points (`n = isqrt(G.order())`) to 2 arrays: `L` and `R`:

- `L` stores `G^0`, `G^1`, `G^2`, ..., `G^n`.
- `R` stores `G^k`, `G^(k-n)`, ..., `G^(k-n*n)`.

If we can find `G^l` in `L` and `G^(k-r*n)` in `R` that `G^l == G^(k-r*n)`, we can solve for `k = l + r*n`.

### Sub-operations

This code divides the process into 3 sub-operations:

#### Fill `L` & `R` 

Filling `L` and `R` with the above points. This part can be space-optimized by storing each point like this:

```
+---------+-------------------------+
|  index  |          G^index        |
+---------+-------------------------+
```

I use multi-threading in this sub-operations to speed up the filling.

#### Sort `L` & `R`

Sort `L` and `R` by each element's `X` coordinate so that we can search for equal values in `O(N)` time. *(this operation takes `O(NlogN)`, however)*

It uses **Quick Sort** to sort the array, allowing an in-place memory sort, thus requiring no additional memory usages.

#### Search `L` and `R`

After the arrays are sorted, we search the equal `X` values in them, then deduce `k` to get the result.
